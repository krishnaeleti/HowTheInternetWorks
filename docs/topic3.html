                The internet protocol address, (IP Address) is like someone’s home address,
                except the IP address isn’t the address of a home but a website. It is a bunch of numbers in a hierarchy,
                has many parts; each number is represented in bits, 32 bits in each part of address each 8-bit
                part consists of Country/Network. Region/Network. Subnetwork. Device address. It is called IPV4 and
                it allows 4 billion unique addresses. We are running out of addresses and a new system is slowly being
                rolled out called IPV6
                which allows for 128 bits per address and in result there will be 340 Undecillion unique addresses.
            <p class="second">
                Packets are exactly that, Packets of information, go in whichever way to get to the destination.
                When someone requests information be it google search or trying to go to a website,
                the information is chopped up into little pieces called packets.
                These broken up pieces of information travel in whichever way to the destination and then get reassembled.
                They don’t choose their routes.
            <p class="third">
                Routing is similar to traffic managers to keep the packets moving smoothly. Transmission Control Protocol.
                Allows the computer to check the inventory of all the packets received.
                These technologies are all fault tolerant and scalable without interrupting any service.

            <p class="first">
                We use IP addresses because since they
                are unique to each computer/device it allows different devices to interact with one another in any network.
            <p class="second">
                Packets are used because the internet is a distributed service, so that a direct connection between one
                to point do another does not need to be established for a message to be sent.
                The message is chopped up into little pieces and send across the network with the
                proper address at the top to make sure it reaches the designated destination.
                This is beneficial because sometime there can be network issues,
                and the packets can choose a different route to take to get to the destination.
            <p class="third">
                Routing is necessary because as stated with packets, they know where to go,
                but only with the help of the routing which aids them in choosing the best possible path to get to their destination.

                Netscape Communications main goal was to
                “take over the world” with their new software
                which allowed the WWW in the hands of any regular person
                in an easy manner. They started working on the next
                version of Mosaic called Netscape Navigator in October 1994.
                They were a budding startup and grew exponentially fast.
                The internet age had begun, they amassed a million downloads
                very quickly.

                Microsoft grew wary of Netscape because
                it felt as if its iron grip on the computing industry
                had been loosened. Where computers could not need the
                Windows Operating System and use only a browser to do
                all the work on a computer.
